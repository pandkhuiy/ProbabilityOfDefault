README file

There are 2 files of MATLAB codes:
- one with the use of Information Value for selecting a subset of the 15 features
- one with the use of forward selection for selecting a subset of the 20 features

The file with Information Value contains the functions called EasyChangeMW  and EasyChange2018.
The file with forward selection contains the functions called EasyChangeMWforward and EasyChangeMWforward2018.

These functions are the main function that call all the base learners and the ensemble methods 
 for either with Information Value approach or with the forward selection approach.

This is how to get all the time series results:

Run the EasyChangeMW function for each pair of quarter: In this case the only thing to change in this code is the year 2001 to 2002
and 2000 to 2001. This can easily be done with Ctrl + h (click on replace all) where all values with 2001 are replaced by 2002 
all the values with 2000 by 2001.  Then run this easyChange function for this pair of qaurters.
Repeat this procedure untile you are at 2017 and 2018.

The EasyChangeMW2018 function only needs to be run once.

This procedure is similar to the main functions EasyChangeMWforward and EasyChangeMWforward2018.

We did this using 19 computers in the computer room of Mandeville building of the Erasmus University Rotterdam
 in order to reduce the waiting time. 

This whole process (running all the computer parallel took us not longer than two to three hours.)

After we ran all the codes at the 19 computers we collected all the results in a separate usb stick and aggregated them
to single MATLAB data files:


Results_BaseLearners_And_Ensembles_NoAdaSyn_MW
Results_BaseLearners_And_Ensembles_WithAdaSyn_MW
results_BaseLeaners_Ensembles_ForwardSelection_MW_NoAdasyn
results_BaseLeaners_Ensembles_ForwardSelection_MW_NoAdasyn

These file were used to compute the time series results the with computeAverageResults... function given the two files.

That's it.
